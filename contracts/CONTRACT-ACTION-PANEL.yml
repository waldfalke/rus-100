description: |
  Standardized UI component that renders a unified action panel at the top of
  tab content (excluding the Tabs themselves). The panel provides a consistent
  left–right layout: filters & toggles on the left; actions on the right. It
  establishes a reusable, accessible pattern for switching sources (e.g., All /
  Platform / My), applying filters, searching, selecting items, and triggering
  actions like "Create". Mobile policy lowers the visual emphasis of additional
  actions: secondary actions collapse to icon-only ghost buttons on small
  screens; text labels appear from the `sm` breakpoint.

props:
  required:
    - name: filterGroups
      type: FilterGroupSpec[]
      description: "Declarative filter groups (chips, selects, toggles) rendered on the left."
    - name: primaryAction
      type: PrimaryActionSpec
      description: "Main CTA on the right (label, icon, onClick, loading)."
  optional:
    - name: sourceSwitcher
      type: SourceSwitcherSpec | null
      default: null
      description: "Three-way source switcher (All / Platform / My). When null, not rendered."
    - name: search
      type: SearchSpec | null
      default: null
      description: "Search input with debounce, placeholder, and onQueryChange callback."
    - name: selectAll
      type: SelectAllSpec | null
      default: null
      description: "Optional select-all control with count and onToggle."
    - name: secondaryActions
      type: SecondaryActionSpec[] | null
      default: []
      description: "Additional low-priority actions (invite, export). Icon-only on mobile by policy."
    - name: density
      type: "compact" | "cozy"
      default: "compact"
      description: "Visual density for spacing scale and control sizes."
    - name: className
      type: string | undefined
      default: undefined
      description: "Optional class for wrapper overrides (non-breaking)."

invariants:
  - "Left–right layout is stable: filters left, actions right, wraps on mobile."
  - "Spacing and sizes use design tokens (no magic numbers)."
  - "Keyboard navigation covers all interactive elements in logical order."
  - "ARIA roles/labels provided for controls; color contrast meets WCAG AA."
  - "Source switcher values are one of: all | platform | my."
  - "No component-owned business logic; callbacks surface changes upstream."
  - "Density consistently maps to spacing and control size tokens."
  - "On <sm screens, secondary actions render as icon-only ghost buttons with tooltips."
  - "On <sm screens, primary action renders as icon-only outline button with aria-label."
  - "No full-width action buttons on mobile (no implicit `w-full` for actions)."
  - "On mobile, all actions are visually de-emphasized (icon-only, outline/ghost variants)."

policy:
  responsive_behavior:
    mobile_breakpoint: "sm"
    secondary_actions_on_mobile: "icon-only ghost buttons with tooltips; text hidden"
    primary_action_on_mobile: "icon-only outline button; text replaced with aria-label for accessibility"
    layout_mobile: "flex-col with items-start; actions do not stretch"

anti_patterns:
  - pattern: "Actions intermixed with content"
    detection: "Create/Export buttons live inside grid/list instead of header"
    why_bad: "Inconsistent UX; duplicate triggers; poor discoverability"
    fix: "Centralize actions in ActionPanel; content triggers only open modals"
  - pattern: "Ad-hoc spacing"
    detection: "Inline styles with arbitrary px values"
    why_bad: "Visual drift and maintenance overhead"
    fix: "Use tokens via tailwind/tokens; map density to spacing scale"
  - pattern: "Hidden keyboard traps"
    detection: "Elements not focusable or incorrect tab order"
    why_bad: "Accessibility regressions"
    fix: "Ensure focus order; use semantic elements and ARIA where needed"
  - pattern: "Stateful filtering inside cards"
    detection: "Per-card filters alter global view state"
    why_bad: "Fragmented control; confusing behavior"
    fix: "Promote global filters to ActionPanel; cards remain passive"

  - "Vitest unit tests for props-driven behavior (switcher, density)"
  - "Viewport-based tests asserting icon-only secondary actions on mobile"

notes:
  - "This contract excludes the Tabs component; focus on the top header panel."
  - "Adoption will occur incrementally per tab to avoid regressions."
  - "TestFormInline establishes minimalist form pattern: no cards/labels, placeholders only, uniform h-9 height, flex-wrap layout with gap-2, responsive buttons (icon-only on mobile, full text on desktop from sm: breakpoint)."
  - "SearchableSelect uses Command component for filtering large option lists (26+ items). Consistent with MultiTagPicker but single-select. Minimum popover width: min-w-[280px]."
  - "Form sizing standards: Input h-9 w-full sm:w-auto sm:min-w-[360px], Selects h-9 w-auto min-w-[180px], buttons use sm:ml-auto for right alignment on desktop."
  - "TestFormInline organism centralizes form pattern to prevent code duplication and AI confusion. Single source of truth for test creation forms across all pages."
