summary: |
  A demo page that displays a collection of specific topics/test types (referred to as "tables") within a Group. 
  It features new cards showing low-level statistics for each of these "tables". The visual style of the cards
  should be similar to the cards on https://openrouter.ai/z-ai/glm-4.6.

reuse:

  - "Existing layout components (e.g., `ResponsiveContainer`) should be used for page structure."
  - "Existing utility functions from `lib/utils.ts` should be used where applicable."

invariants:
  - "The page must display a card for each 'table' (topic/test type) provided by the user."
  - "Each card must display the 'table' name and relevant low-level statistics (e.g., average score, completion rate, number of associated tasks)."
  - "The page must be responsive and display correctly on mobile and desktop devices."
  blast_radius:
    - "All changes must be confined to the new page `app/group-tables-demo/page.tsx` and its associated new components."
    - "No changes should be made to existing components or pages outside of the new page's scope unless explicitly approved."
    - "The `statistics-adapter.ts` may be extended, but not in a way that breaks existing functionality."
