## Description

This contract defines the structure, management, and application of synonyms within the CATMEPIM system. It establishes standards for identifying, storing, and utilizing linguistic and conceptual equivalences across the system to improve search, categorization, and data normalization capabilities.

## Purpose

This contract:
- Defines how synonyms are structured and stored
- Establishes relationships between equivalent terms
- Specifies synonym application contexts
- Outlines synonym discovery, approval, and management processes
- Enables consistent search enhancement across the system
- Supports multilingual synonym mapping

## Core Concepts

1. **Synonym**: A word or phrase that has the same or nearly the same meaning as another word or phrase
2. **Synonym Group**: A collection of terms that are considered equivalent in a specific context
3. **Synonym Strength**: The degree of equivalence between terms (exact, close, related)
4. **Context**: The domain or situation in which the synonym relationship is valid
5. **Directionality**: Whether the synonym relationship is bidirectional or unidirectional

## Synonym Entity Definition

```json
{
  "synonym_group_id": "unique identifier for the synonym group",
  "canonical_term": {
    "term": "the preferred/standard term",
    "language_code": "ISO language code",
    "domain": "field or subject area"
  },
  "synonyms": [
    {
      "term": "equivalent term",
      "language_code": "ISO language code",
      "strength": "exact|close|related",
      "directionality": "bidirectional|to_canonical|from_canonical",
      "notes": "explanation of the relationship"
    }
  ],
  "contexts": [
    {
      "context_id": "identifier for application context",
      "context_type": "search|categorization|normalization|translation",
      "is_active": "boolean indicating if synonym is active in this context"
    }
  ],
  "status": "active|proposed|deprecated",
  "source": "origin of the synonym relationship (dictionary, user-defined, etc.)",
  "metadata": {
    "created_date": "record creation timestamp",
    "modified_date": "last modification timestamp",
    "created_by": "user or process that created the record",
    "approved_by": "user who approved the synonym (if applicable)"
  }
}
```

## Synonym Application Contexts

Synonyms are applied in different contexts, each with specific requirements:

### 1. Search Enhancement

Synonyms expand search queries to include equivalent terms, improving recall:

```java
public interface SearchSynonymService {
    /**
     * Expand a search term with its synonyms
     */
    List<String> expandSearchTerms(String term, String languageCode, String domain);
    
    /**
     * Get synonym groups that apply to a search term
     */
    List<SynonymGroup> getSynonymGroupsForTerm(String term, String languageCode);
    
    /**
     * Apply synonyms to a search query
     */
    SearchQuery expandSearchQuery(SearchQuery originalQuery);
}
```

### 2. Data Normalization

Synonyms standardize variant terms to preferred canonical forms:

```java
public interface NormalizationSynonymService {
    /**
     * Convert a term to its canonical form
     */
    String normalizeToCanonical(String term, String languageCode, String domain);
    
    /**
     * Determine if a term is a synonym for a canonical term
     */
    boolean isTermSynonymFor(String term, String canonicalTerm, String languageCode);
    
    /**
     * Get all synonyms that would normalize to the given canonical term
     */
    List<String> getAllSynonymsForCanonical(String canonicalTerm, String languageCode);
}
```

### 3. Categorization Support

Synonyms support consistent categorization across variant terms:

```java
public interface CategorizationSynonymService {
    /**
     * Find categories applicable to a term considering synonyms
     */
    List<Category> getCategoriesForTermWithSynonyms(String term, String languageCode);
    
    /**
     * Check if a term belongs to a category considering synonyms
     */
    boolean isTermInCategory(String term, String categoryId, String languageCode);
}
```

### 4. Translation Support

Synonyms facilitate cross-language term mapping:

```java
public interface TranslationSynonymService {
    /**
     * Get synonyms for a term in a different language
     */
    List<String> getTranslatedSynonyms(String term, String sourceLanguage, String targetLanguage);
    
    /**
     * Get all language variants of a term across synonym groups
     */
    Map<String, List<String>> getAllLanguageVariants(String term, String sourceLanguage);
}
```

## Synonym Discovery and Management

### Discovery Mechanisms

The system supports multiple methods for synonym discovery:

1. **Manual Definition**: User-specified synonym relationships
2. **Dictionary Integration**: Import from linguistic resources
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Identification through usage pattern analysis
4. **User Feedback**: Capture of user-suggested relationships
5. **External API Integration**: Import from knowledge graphs or semantic services

### Approval Process

New synonym relationships follow an approval workflow:

1. Initial proposal (automated or manual)
2. Review by domain experts
3. Testing in isolated context
4. Approval and activation
5. Monitoring for effectiveness

### Conflict Resolution

When synonym conflicts arise (contradictory relationships), the system must:

1. Identify the conflict
2. Present evidence for conflicting relationships
3. Resolve with domain specificity or preference rules
4. Document resolution decisions

## Multilingual Support

The contract supports synonyms across languages through:

1. **Language-Specific Synonym Groups**: Relationships specific to each language
2. **Cross-Language Mappings**: Equivalences between terms in different languages
3. **Translation Bridges**: Using canonical terms as bridges between languages
4. **Script Variations**: Handling different writing systems for the same language

## Synonym Group Structure

Synonym groups can be structured in multiple ways:

### Flat Synonym Groups

All terms in the group are considered equivalent:

```
Group: {A, B, C, D}
Meaning: A ↔ B ↔ C ↔ D
```

### Hierarchical Synonym Groups

Terms have a canonical form and variant forms:

```
Group: {A → B, A → C, A → D}
Meaning: A is canonical; B, C, D are variants of A
```

### Weighted Synonym Relations

Terms have varying degrees of equivalence:

```
Group: {A ↔(0.9) B, A ↔(0.7) C, A ↔(0.5) D}
Meaning: A and B are highly equivalent, A and C are moderately equivalent, etc.
```

## Data Storage Requirements

Synonym data requires:

1. Efficient lookup from any term to its synonym group
2. Support for context-specific filtering
3. Versioning of synonym relationships
4. Low-latency access for real-time applications
5. Bulk update capabilities

1. Retrieve synonyms for a term in under 50ms
2. Support at least 10,000 synonym groups
3. Handle at least 1,000 synonym lookups per second
4. Process bulk synonym updates without service disruption

## Synonym Maintenance

The system must provide tools for:

1. **Auditing**: Reviewing synonym usage and effectiveness
2. **Cleanup**: Identifying and resolving orphaned or conflicting synonyms
3. **Expansion**: Suggesting new potential synonym relationships
4. **Deprecation**: Phasing out problematic or outdated synonyms
5. **Impact Analysis**: Evaluating how synonym changes affect system behavior

1. Support all defined synonym structures and relationships
2. Implement the specified context-specific interfaces
3. Enforce validation rules
