## Description

This contract defines how data lineage is tracked, recorded, and queried within the CATMEPIM system. It establishes standards for capturing the origin, transformation, and movement of data throughout its lifecycle, enabling traceability, compliance verification, and quality assessment.

## Purpose

This contract:
- Defines the structure for capturing data lineage information
- Establishes methods for tracking data transformations and movements
- Enables auditing of data flows and changes
- Supports data quality assessment through origin tracking
- Facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements for data provenance
- Provides a framework for impact analysis of data changes

## Data Lineage Model

### Core Entities

#### 1. Data Element

Represents an individual data item being tracked:

```json
{
  "element_id": "unique identifier for this data element",
  "element_type": "product|price|category|attribute|series|etc",
  "business_key": "natural key that identifies the element in its domain",
  "current_version": "latest version number",
  "creation_timestamp": "when the element was first created",
  "last_modified_timestamp": "when the element was last modified"
}
```

#### 2. Lineage Record

Captures a single event in the data element's history:

```json
{
  "lineage_id": "unique identifier for this lineage record",
  "element_id": "reference to the data element",
  "element_version": "version of the data element this record applies to",
  "timestamp": "when this lineage event occurred",
  "operation_type": "create|update|delete|merge|split|derive|transform|import|export",
  "operation_details": {
    "field_changes": [
      {
        "field_name": "name of changed field",
        "previous_value": "value before change (null if newly created)",
        "new_value": "value after change (null if deleted)",
        "change_reason": "explanation for the change"
      }
    ]
  },
  "source": {
    "source_type": "user|system|external|batch|api",
    "source_identifier": "identifier of the specific source",
    "source_details": "additional information about the source"
  },
  "context": {
    "session_id": "identifier for user/system session",
    "transaction_id": "identifier for the transaction",
    "batch_id": "identifier for batch process (if applicable)"
  },
  "predecessors": [
    {
      "element_id": "ID of predecessor element",
      "element_version": "version of predecessor element",
      "relationship_type": "copied_from|derived_from|merged_from|split_from|imported_from"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "data_quality_score": "quality assessment of the data at this point",
    "confidence_level": "confidence in the lineage information",
    "notes": "additional information about this lineage event"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Process Execution

Records information about the process that created or modified data:

```json
{
  "process_execution_id": "unique identifier for this process execution",
  "process_type": "import|export|validation|enrichment|transformation|cleanup",
  "process_name": "specific named process",
  "process_version": "version of the process",
  "start_timestamp": "when process started",
  "end_timestamp": "when process completed",
  "status": "successful|failed|partial",
  "affecting_parameters": "parameters that influenced the process outcome",
  "affected_elements_count": "number of data elements affected",
  "execution_context": {
    "user_id": "user who initiated or was responsible for the process",
    "system_id": "system that executed the process",
    "environment": "production|test|development",
    "triggered_by": "event or schedule that triggered the process"
  },
  "related_lineage_records": [
    "lineage_id1", "lineage_id2", "..."
  ]
}
```

## Lineage Tracking Interfaces

### Recording Lineage

```java
public interface DataLineageRecorder {
    /**
     * Record creation of a new data element
     */
    LineageRecord recordCreation(DataElement element, Source source, Context context);
    
    /**
     * Record update to an existing data element
     */
    LineageRecord recordUpdate(DataElement element, FieldChanges changes, Source source, Context context);
    
    /**
     * Record deletion of a data element
     */
    LineageRecord recordDeletion(DataElement element, DeletionReason reason, Source source, Context context);
    
    /**
     * Record data derived from other elements
     */
    LineageRecord recordDerivation(DataElement derivedElement, List<ElementReference> sourceElements, 
                                  DerivationDetails details, Source source, Context context);
    
    /**
     * Record import from external source
     */
    LineageRecord recordImport(DataElement importedElement, ExternalSource source, 
                               ImportDetails details, Context context);
    
    /**
     * Record process execution
     */
    ProcessExecution recordProcessExecution(Process process, ExecutionContext context);
    
    /**
     * Link process execution to affected lineage records
     */
    void linkProcessToLineage(String processExecutionId, List<String> lineageIds);
}
```

### Querying Lineage

```java
public interface DataLineageQuery {
    /**
     * Get complete lineage history for a data element
     */
    List<LineageRecord> getElementHistory(String elementId);
    
    /**
     * Get specific version of a data element
     */
    LineageRecord getElementVersion(String elementId, String version);
    
    /**
     * Trace data element back to its origins
     */
    LineageGraph traceToOrigin(String elementId, String version);
    
    /**
     * Find all elements derived from a specific element
     */
    List<ElementReference> findDerivedElements(String sourceElementId);
    
    /**
     * Find all elements affected by a process execution
     */
    List<ElementReference> findElementsAffectedByProcess(String processExecutionId);
    
    /**
     * Find all processes that affected an element
     */
    List<ProcessExecution> findProcessesAffectingElement(String elementId);
    
    /**
     * Search lineage records by criteria
     */
    List<LineageRecord> searchLineage(LineageSearchCriteria criteria);
}
```

## Lineage Visualization

The system must support visualization of lineage information:

1. **Lineage Graphs**: Directed graphs showing data element relationships
2. **Timeline Views**: Chronological representation of data element history
3. **Process Flow Diagrams**: Visual representation of data transformations
4. **Impact Diagrams**: Visualizations showing change propagation

## Lineage Capture Points

Lineage must be captured at the following points:

1. **Data Creation**: When new data elements are created
2. **Data Modification**: When existing data is updated
3. **Data Deletion**: When data is removed from the system
4. **Data Import**: When data is brought in from external sources
5. **Data Export**: When data is sent to external systems
6. **Data Transformation**: When data is derived or calculated
7. **Data Validation**: When data quality is verified
8. **Data Merging**: When multiple records are combined
9. **Data Splitting**: When a record is split into multiple records

## Automated vs. Manual Lineage Capture

The system supports both:

1. **Automated Capture**: System processes automatically record lineage
2. **Manual Capture**: Users provide lineage information when making changes
3. **Hybrid Capture**: System captures basic lineage, users augment with context

## Lineage Granularity Levels

Lineage can be tracked at different levels of detail:

1. **Field-Level**: Changes to individual data fields
2. **Record-Level**: Changes to entire data records
3. **Dataset-Level**: Changes to collections of records
4. **Process-Level**: Tracking of process executions that affect data

## Lineage Storage Requirements

Lineage data requires:

1. Efficient storage for large volumes of lineage records
2. Fast retrieval for common lineage queries
3. Flexible query capabilities for complex lineage analysis
4. Long-term retention for compliance purposes
5. Compressed storage for historical lineage data
6. Partitioning strategy for improved performance

## Performance Requirements

3. Support efficient querying of lineage history (retrieve element history in <500ms)
4. Scale to handle billions of lineage records
5. Support archiving of older lineage data while maintaining accessibility

## Compliance and Governance

The lineage system must support:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Tracking data for regulatory requirements
2. **Audit Support**: Providing evidence for system audits
3. **Data Privacy**: Tracking sensitive data handling
4. **Data Quality**: Monitoring and reporting on data quality metrics
5. **Change Management**: Supporting controlled data changes

## Implementation Requirements
