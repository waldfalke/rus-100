```

The system supports intelligent mode switching based on both prompt analysis and operational needs:

1. **Intent-Based Triggers**:
   ```yaml
   mode_switching:
     enabled: true
     preserve_context: true
     intent_triggers:
         code:
           - implement
           - create
           - build
           - code
           - develop
           - fix
         debug:
           - debug
           - troubleshoot
           - diagnose
           - investigate
           - analyze
           - trace
           - root cause
         architect:
           - design
           - architect
           - structure
           - plan
         ask:
           - explain
           - help
           - what
           - how
           - why
   ```

2. **Operational Triggers**:
   - **File-based**: Switches based on file operations
   - **Mode-specific**: Contextual switches based on task type
   - **Capability-based**: Switches to mode with required capabilities

3. **Context Preservation**:
   - Maintains task state across switches
   - Preserves conversation history
   - Tracks active files and operations

4. **Benefits**:

Memory Bank for Refactoring: Complex Code Module

Memory Bank Initialization: Quick Workflow

The Memory Bank initialization is largely automatic. Here‚Äôs a simplified view of the process:

1. **Start in Architect or Code Mode:** When you open a new project in VS Code and switch to Architect or Code mode, Roo Code automatically checks for a `memory-bank/`.
2. **Initialization Plan:** If `memory-bank/` is missing, Roo Code (in Architect mode) will guide you with a plan to set it up.
3. **Switch to Code Mode:** Follow Roo's prompt to switch to Code mode.
4. **Create Memory Bank Files:** In Code mode, follow Roo's plan to create the `memory-bank/` directory and the necessary files.
5. **Memory Bank Ready:** Once files are created, your Memory Bank is initialized and ready for use.


Handling Multiple Projects in a Workspace


If you have multiple projects with their own Memory Banks within your VS Code workspace, Roo Code can automatically detect them and prompt you to select the target project for the current chat session.

Handling Multiple Projects in a Workspace


If you have multiple projects with their own Memory Banks within your VS Code workspace, Roo Code can automatically detect them and prompt you to select the target project for the current chat session.


Automatic Project Detection and Selection:


1. New Chat Session: When you start a new chat session in Architect or Code mode, Roo Code scans your workspace for `memory-bank/` directories.
2. Multiple Memory Banks Found: If multiple `memory-bank/` directories are detected, Roo Code will display a prompt in the chat asking you to choose the project you want to work on.
3. Project Selection Prompt: Roo Code will display a prompt asking you to choose your project.  It will look something like this in the chat:

```text
Multiple Memory Banks detected.

Please select the project for this session:

1. poptools-app
2. Roo-Code
3. roo-code-memory-bank

Enter the number of your project choice.
```
4. Select Your Project: Enter the number corresponding to the project you want to work with and press Enter.
5. Context Loaded: Roo Code will then load the Memory Bank for the selected project and use it for the current chat session.

Example Scenario: Multi-Project Workspace

Let's say you have a workspace with multiple projects, like `webapp` and `mobile-app`, each with its own `memory-bank/` directory.

When you initiate a new chat in Architect mode, Roo Code will detect both Memory Banks and ask you to select the project you want to focus on for this session. The prompt will look similar to the example below:

```text
Multiple Memory Banks detected.

Please select the project for this session:

1. webapp
2. mobile-app

Enter the number of your project choice.
```
By choosing '1', Roo Code will then use the Memory Bank from your `webapp` project for this session.

By selecting '1', you ensure that Roo Code uses the Memory Bank from your `webapp` project for this session.


Organizing Multi-Project Workspaces:


To effectively manage multiple projects with Memory Banks:

* Keep Memory Banks at Project Roots: Ensure each project has its `memory-bank/` directory at the root level of its project directory.
* Clear Project Names: Use descriptive names for your project directories to easily identify them in the project selection prompt.
* Workspace Structure: Organize your workspace so that project directories are clearly separated.

This automatic project detection and selection feature simplifies working with multiple projects and ensures Roo Code always has the correct project context for each session.

Troubleshooting


`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` Prefix Not Working


Solution: Check Custom Instructions
1. Verify custom instruction settings in VS Code: Ensure all custom instruction modules are correctly configured in "Roo Code Prompts" settings, especially "Mode-specific Custom Instructions/Code".
 * Detailed Verification Checklist:
  - [ ] **Global Instructions:** Verify that you have copied the *entire content* of the file `roo-code-memory-bank/custom-instructions/global-instructions.md` and pasted it into the "Global Instructions" setting within the "Roo Code Prompts" section in VS Code settings.
  - [ ] **Mode-specific Instructions/Architect:** Verify that you have copied the *entire content* of `roo-code-memory-bank/custom-instructions/mode-arch.md` and pasted it into the "Mode-specific Instructions/Architect" setting.
  - [ ] **Mode-specific Instructions/Ask:** Verify that you have copied the *entire content* of `roo-code-memory-bank/custom-instructions/mode-ask.md` and pasted it into the "Mode-specific Instructions/Ask" setting.
  - [ ] **Mode-specific Instructions/Code:** **Crucially**, verify that you have copied the *entire content* of `roo-code-memory-bank/custom-instructions/mode-code.md` and pasted it into the "Mode-specific Custom Instructions/Code" setting. **This specific setting is essential for the `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` prefix to function correctly in Code mode.**
 * Content Integrity: Double-check that you have copied the *complete content* of *each* specified file and pasted it into the *corresponding* settings area, ensuring no content was missed or corrupted during the copy-paste process.
2. Save Settings: Verify that VS Code settings were saved after pasting instructions.
3. Confirm Code Mode: Ensure you are in "Code" mode when using `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` prefix (check Roo Code chat interface).
4. Check Prefix Syntax: Verify exact syntax: `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` (case-sensitive, spacing).


Memory Bank Not Persisting After VS Code Restart


Solution:
1. Verify Memory Bank Initialization: Confirm that you have initiated the Memory Bank initialization process by switching to Architect mode in a new project (see "Getting Started" section). Check if the `memory-bank/` folder and essential files were created at the project root after following the initialization plan provided by Roo Code in Architect mode.
2. Initial Mode Switch: After VS Code restart, switch to "Ask" or "Architect" mode *first* to trigger Memory Bank loading.
3. Use "Update Memory Bank" (UMB) Command: Use "update memory bank" or **"UMB" as a standalone prompt** at session end to explicitly trigger the comprehensive Memory Bank update and prepare for the next session.
4. Check File Paths: Verify `memory-bank/` folder is at project root; incorrect paths prevent Memory Bank access.


.clinerules Rules Not Applied


Solution:
1. File Location: Ensure `.clinerules` files (`.clinerules`, `.clinerules-code`, etc.) are at project root, alongside `memory-bank/` folder.
2. Syntax Check: Verify `.clinerules` file syntax; incorrect syntax may cause rules to be ignored.
3. Mode Relevance: Note that `.clinerules-code`, `.clinerules-architect`, `.clinerules-ask` are mode-specific.
4. Restart Roo Code (Rare):  Restart Roo Code in VS Code after major `.clinerules` changes to reload rules.


Memory Bank Files Not Updating/Saving


Solution:
1. File Permissions: Check write permissions for `memory-bank/` folder and files.
2. VS Code Errors: Check VS Code console for file saving errors.
3. Conflicting Extensions: Temporarily disable extensions that might interfere with saving.
4. Disk Space: Ensure sufficient free disk space is available.


If issues persist, consult the Roo Code documentation or community support channels for further assistance.


Revised Guidance on "Update Memory Bank" (UMB) Command:


Although not strictly *required* after every break, using the **"Update Memory Bank" (UMB) command** (typing "update memory bank" or "UMB" as a standalone prompt in chat) is **highly recommended and should be considered a best practice** for robust session management and ensuring long-term project context preservation.  **Triggering UMB as a standalone prompt ensures a comprehensive update of all Memory Bank files, guaranteeing accurate and persistent project knowledge.**


To visualize this session management process, refer to the workflow diagram below:


Session Management Workflow (`update memory bank` Command)


[//]: # (TODO: Replace ASCII diagram below with a visual flowchart image)
[//]: # (Visual flowchart image should illustrate the Session Management Workflow with `update memory bank` command. A flowchart would be more user-friendly than the current ASCII diagram.)


1. Start: Working on Project (Any Mode)
2. Step 1: User makes changes to Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, etc.)
3. Step 2: Session End or Break?
 Yes: User initiates `update memory bank` command in chat
 No: Continue Working (Loop back to Step 1)
4. Step 3: Roo Code saves current state of Memory Bank files
5. Step 4: Memory Bank is prepared for next session
6. End: Session Managed & Memory Bank Updated


Think of it as:
* `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` Prefix:  Ensures Roo uses *documented, reliable* project context in Code mode (important for memory resets).
* `update memory bank` Command: "Save project knowledge" command. Use it to:
  * Update Memory Bank at session end/breaks.
  * Prepare for VS Code closure/workspace switch.
  * Create project history checkpoints.
