# CMP-015-002: Audit breadcrumb components for hardcoded values

**Contract:** TD-COMP-001
**Epic:** EPIC-COMPONENTS
**Status:** TODO
**Owner:** @team

## Overview
Audit breadcrumb.tsx and BreadcrumbsBlock.tsx for hardcoded colors, spacing, or styles that should use design tokens.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review both breadcrumb.tsx and BreadcrumbsBlock.tsx for hardcoded values
- [ ] Check for hardcoded colors in breadcrumb styling
- [ ] Verify spacing uses token system
- [ ] Add @token-status annotations to both files
- [ ] Document any migration needed

## Implementation Plan
1. Read breadcrumb.tsx and BreadcrumbsBlock.tsx source code
2. Search for hardcoded values (colors, sizes, spacing)
3. Compare with available tokens in design-tokens/tokens.json
4. Identify necessary changes for both components
5. Update @token-status annotations
6. Create follow-up tasks if migration needed

## Validation
- [ ] No hardcoded hex colors found (or replaced with tokens)
- [ ] No hardcoded px values (or replaced with spacing tokens)
- [ ] Components use only token-based Tailwind classes

## Notes
Part of TOK-010 token migration audit. Both breadcrumb components need to be audited together as they work as a system.
